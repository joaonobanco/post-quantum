Quantum computing has the potential to play a significant role in technological transformation due to its capacity to perform computations and operations currently beyond the reach of classical computers. Consequently, quantum computing introduces security risks in the transmission and validation of information, should it become feasible to break standard encryption algorithms.

Safeguarding against quantum computers is of paramount importance, given their potential to encrypt data securely today, only to decrypt it at will in the future. The "encrypt now, decrypt later" capability presents a profound threat to the enduring confidentiality of sensitive information and the stability of digital security protocols.

This research holds particular significance in light of the current existence of quantum algorithms with the potential to compromise the security of prevailing classical cryptographic algorithms, which serve as pillars in the security and confidentiality of digital systems.
